Credit Card Fraud Detection

Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task that helps protect credit card holders from fraudulent transactions. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 10,000 rows and 15 columns, including features such as transaction amount, location, and time.

Methodology
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Feature engineering: Creating new features that capture relevant information.
3. Model selection: Comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model parameters using cross-validation and grid search.

Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 95.6% and a precision score of 94.8%. The most important features contributing to the prediction were transaction amount, location, and time.
